# DebianAwesome

This is my Personal daily configuration of Debian, with the Awesome Window Manager.
The Theme comes from https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats and i choose the powerarrow-dark theme.
This is a easy and quick way to have some nice themes. I stripped down the used widgets to just the clock.
Maybe in the future i will add one or 2, but not to many, i like it simple.


I use the St, Dmenu and lfub build of Luke Smith for efficient daily uses.

This Readme will be extended in the future. For personal Use.
