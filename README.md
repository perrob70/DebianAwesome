# DebianAwesome

This is my daily configuration of my Debian Desktop with the Awesome Window Manager.
I am not making other configurations with other Window Managers, i like to stick with the one that
fits my own personal needs. My Distro of choice is Debian and Window Manager Awesome.
The Theme comes from https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats and i choose the powerarrow-dark theme.
This is a easy and quick way to have some nice themes. I stripped down the used widgets to just the clock.
Maybe in the future i will add one or 2, but not to many, i like it simple.


I use the St, Dmenu and lfub build of Luke Smith for efficient daily uses.

This Readme will be extended in the future.
